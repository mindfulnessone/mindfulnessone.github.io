Katarina Tabi is a mindfulness teacher and a neuroscientist passionate about exploring the world and understanding the nature of life.

Katarina is a qualified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) teacher, trained by the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Centre for Mindfulness. She teaches from the heart of her own practice, which is being nourished daily, as well as by regularly attending silent meditation retreats. Katarina has practiced and learned under the guidance of teachers including Saki Santorelli, Lynn Koerbel, Florence Meleo-Meyer, Tara Brach, Jack Kornfield, Steve Armstrong, Sharon Salzberg, Rick Hanson, and others.
Katarina is interested and open to a variety of techniques that help people cultivate awareness, well-being, resilience, and happiness. She seeks to understand them through the perspectives of both the evidence-based science and pure human experience supported by thousand years old practices.
 
Katarina has worked in the research of brain and mind most of her professional career. With a background in neuropsychopharmacology, the interest in questions what makes some people thrive and some people suffer, led her to dive into the area of mental health. Her PhD project in e-Mental Health looks into how technology can innovate and increase accessibility to mental health care. At present, Katarina works at the Reproductive Mental Health Clinic in BC Childrenâ€™ s Hospital in Vancouver, where she designs new research studies and projects with the intention to help new families affected by mental issues to live a healthier and happier life.

The more personal version

One of the many things I am grateful for is the sense of curiosity my parents and family have supported since my early upbringing. That allowed me to freely explore and create as a child and teenager and overcome most of the challenges of that time period with relative ease. Things started to fall apart when I first moved abroad at the age of 18 and enrolled in the university as an undergraduate student. Intense stress of different kinds (workload, feelings of not being good enough, social stress, deeper loneliness, fear of failure, wanting things to be different than they are, ruminating about all the decisions and thoughts over and over again, etc.) was overwhelming. I felt powerless. However, deep inside I felt there needs to be a different way to live this life than a constant stress and fear. I just had no idea how.

Without really knowing much, one of the things I started to do and noticed it feels good, was a slow movement I start my day with when all that matters is the movement. It happened, I maintain this practice until today.

One day, during a family visit, I noticed a book lying on a table called Search Inside Yourself. From a pure curiosity, I gave it a short check. The fact that it was written by a pragmatic software programmer and referenced work of different medical scientists who I respected since I could relate to their work through my own background, worked well and convinced the strict evidence-oriented scientist inside me. I borrowed the book and read it. That was the beginning of my own journey into mindfulness, understanding the self and the mind.

In my professional life, I was actively pursuing the research and academic career in neuroscience and teaching at the medical school. Meanwhile, I came across an opportunity to travel from Central Europe (where I was born and raised and in different areas studied and worked) to Canada and experience a small cultural exchange for a few months. During that, I fell in love with Vancouver and the small travel turned into a few year stay.

For a long time, mindfulness was something I practiced and learned about for my own sake. Slowly but surely, it happened to be an important foundation of my life. Years later I have decided to get a formal education in the topic and perhaps share the teachings with others, so they can benefit at least the same way I did.

The ongoing daily practice helps me to uncover and observe some of my deeply rooted tendencies and sometimes laugh or smile. Solid research backs what I see firsthand daily. Mindfulness helps rewire some of the old patterns. Seeing them more clearly with less of the stories and judgment. Practicing compassion and loving kindness bring another powerful quality into daily life.

I truly enjoy being in a forest or other outdoor places, dancing without given steps and generally moving the body (cycling, yoga, running, walking and hiking). The dance can get pretty wild sometimes. Not a bad balance to all the meditating ;)
