## Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)

Designed in 1979 by Professor John Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, MBSR is the gold-standard in mindfulness interventions. Three decades of published research indicate that the majority of people who complete this standardized program report greater ability to cope more effectively with stressful situations and improvement in their quality of life. The program supports participants to draw on their inner resources and natural capacity to actively engage in caring for themselves and finding greater balance, ease, and peace of mind.

#### How the MBSR program works?
MBSR is an intensive structured group program that provides instruction in
mindfulness meditation practices to heighten awareness of how we react to both
emotional and physical pain. It addresses the stresses of coping with challenging
symptoms and serves as a valuable complement and support to regular medical
treatment. Taking part in MBSR has been linked to positive changes in the areas of
the brain that affect how we pay attention, how we feel, and how we think.

#### Program structure
MBSR program consists of:
- 8 weekly classes (each class for 2.5h-3h) 
- One daylong retreat session (6h)
- Audio recordings to guide home practice
- weekly handouts
 
The program includes: 
- mindfulness meditation practices
- gentle stretching and mindful movement (with options for all ages and needs)
- walking with awareness
- talks on different topics
- group dialogue
- home practice

Daily home practice is strongly encouraged and supported with take-home materials.


## What Is Mindfulness?

Mindfulness means being aware of the present moment experience - our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, or surrounding environment, through a gentle and nurturing lens. Mindfulness also involves acceptance, meaning that we pay attention to our thoughts and feelings without judging them—without believing that there’s a “right” or “wrong” way to think or feel in a given moment. When we practice mindfulness, our mind tunes into what we’re experiencing in the present moment rather than ruminating on the past or anticipating the future.
